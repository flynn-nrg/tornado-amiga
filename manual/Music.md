Music
=====

No demo would be complete without a soundtrack. Tornado provides three ways to play music:

* Old school [Amiga modules](https://modarchive.org/index.php?article-modules) using [The Player](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=64049) by Sahara Surfers.
* [Pretracker](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=80999) modules.
* DDPCM compressed stereo 14bit audio up to 22050Hz.

Using modules
---------------------

Modules have the advantage of potentially requiring a very small amount of memory and are best suited for intros. Capsule's 2018 [Renouncetro](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=75732) 64Kib intro is such an example.

Tornado contains two copies of the P61 replay routine: One that's AmigaOS friendly and thus can be used before the demo has started, e.g. while the demo is loading, and one that uses direct hardware access and can only be used while the demo is running.

An example of how to use module music in your demo can be seen in the [Anatomy of a Demo](AnatomyOfADemo.md) section which uses the ```simple_screen``` example as a guide.

A few things to keep in mind:

* You can have as many modules as you want as long as you call ```p61Init``` and ```p61End``` for each of them.
* Modules need to reside in Chip RAM. Make sure the module data resides in Chip RAM.
* Module replay **only** works on the Amiga target. You will not hear anything when running your demo on the posix/SDL target.
* Because profiling needs the CIAB timer which is used by the module replay routine, it is not possible to have profiling and music at the same time on Amiga. Please refer to the [Performance Monitoring](PerformanceMonitoring.md) section for more information on this topic.

Using Pretracker modules
--------------

Tornado provides wrapper routines that allow you to use the Pretracker replay routine. A ready made example is available under the ```examples/simple_screen_prt``` directory.

Pretracker modules are ideal for intros as they need very little amount of storage and the precalc phase is very fast on accelerated Amigas.

Since the replay routine is called from the VBL handler, that frees up the CIAB hardware so you can use the profiler while the music is playing.

All you have to do is load the asset and then call the init routine, like this:

```c
const char *audioList[] = {"data/aceman_glitch.prt"};

  // Allocate memory for the generated samples
  // and initialise the song and replay routine.
#ifdef __AMIGA__
  if (tornadoOptions & VERBOSE_DEBUGGING) {
    printf("DEBUG - Pretracker init...");
  }  
  chipBuffer = tndo_malloc(128*1024, TNDO_ALLOC_CHIP);
  prtInit(chipBuffer, audioAssets[0]);
  if (tornadoOptions & VERBOSE_DEBUGGING) {
    printf("done.\n");
  }    
#endif
```

And then you call the tick function every vblank:

```c
  // Call Pretracker tick every vblank.
#ifdef __AMIGA__
  prtVBL();
#endif
```

Last but not least we will shutdown Paula at the end of demoMain:

```c
  // Stop music.
#ifdef __AMIGA__
  prtEnd();
#endif
```

Using DDPCM compressed music
----------------------------------------------

As a composer myself, the idea of our music being butchered by the 4bit [ADPCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_differential_pulse-code_modulation) compression wasn't very appealing. While this algorithm results in small audio assets, it does not sound good. I always say that ADPCM-encoded music sounds nice if you've never listened to the original.

For that reason I've developed my own [DPCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_pulse-code_modulation) encoder that delivers very good quality with low decoding overhead and a reasonable compression ratio of about 2.4:1. 

A highly optimised replay routine is provided with the framework.

The first thing you need is a 16bit stereo WAV file with data saved at one of these supported sampling rates:

* 11025Hz
* 22050Hz

A 11025Hz version of the music is practical during development as it minimises loading times. For the release version of your demo we recommend that you create a 22050Hz file to obtain the highest quality.

Let's convert a WAV file to a TNDO audio file:

```

```
 
Now let's take a look at what we did in the ```blur``` example to play music:


We have the compressed version of our music in the data directory:

```
thunderball:blur mmendez$ ls -la data/brut*
-rw-r--r--  1 mmendez  staff  1185880 18 Aug 15:56 data/brut_ddpcm.tndo
```

We have also set the ```USE_AUDIO``` flag in our demo settings function:

```c
void demoSettings(demoParams *dp) {
  dp->minCPU = MIN_CPU_040;
  dp->tornadoOptions =
      CLOSE_OS | LOGGING | INSTALL_LEVEL3 | INSTALL_LEVEL2 | USE_AUDIO;
```

*NOTE*: If you need to use every possibly CPU cycle you can decompress the DDPCM stream during loading time by setting the `DDPCM_UNPACK` in your tornadoOptions. The tradeoff is, of course, increased memory use. On a 50Mhz 68060 processor the realtime decompression plus the mixing and copying to the chip memory buffers consumes 1.1ms per frame whereas the pre-decompressed version just needs 0.5ms.

And this is our audio init function:

```c
// --------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Music initialisation.
// --------------------------------------------------------------------------
static int *audioSizes;
static int numAudioAssets;
static void **audioAssets;

const char *audioList[] = {"data/brut_ddpcm.tndo"};

void demoAudioInit(unsigned int tornadoOptions) {
  int offset = 0;

  if (tornadoOptions & USE_AUDIO) {
    numAudioAssets = sizeof(audioList) / sizeof(char *);
    audioSizes = (int *)tndo_malloc(sizeof(int) * numAudioAssets, 0);
    audioAssets = (void **)tndo_malloc(sizeof(void *) * numAudioAssets, 0);
    if (tornadoOptions & VERBOSE_DEBUGGING) {
      printf("DEBUG - Loading audio data...");
      fflush(stdout);
    }
    if (!loadAssets(&audioAssets[0], &audioList[0], &audioSizes[0],
                    numAudioAssets, tornadoOptions, my_dp)) {
      tndo_memory_shutdown(tornadoOptions);
      if (tornadoOptions & VERBOSE_DEBUGGING) {
        printf("failed!\n");
      }
      exit(1);
    }

    musicSecond = my_dp->sampleRate * (my_dp->bitsPerSample / 8);
    offset = (effects[currentEffect].minTime / 50) * musicSecond;
    musicBeginL = *my_dp->mixState;
    musicBeginR = *my_dp->mixState2;
    *my_dp->mixState = musicBeginL + offset;
    *my_dp->mixState2 = musicBeginR + offset;

    if (tornadoOptions & VERBOSE_DEBUGGING) {
      printf("done.\n");
    }
  }

#ifndef __AMIGA__
  // SDL Audio initialization.
  if (tornadoOptions & USE_AUDIO) {
    if (Audio_Init(my_dp, offset)) {
      fprintf(stderr, "FATAL - Failed to init SDL audio. Aborting.\n");
      exit(1);
    }
  }
#endif
}
```

This function is loading and uncompressing the audio data using the [Asset Manager](AssetManager.md). This happens on the posix/SDL target as well, as it is also the data used for music replay. The reason for this is to make sure that the audio unpacking code path is working correctly.

On posix/SDL only we are also initialising the SDL_Mixer library replay routine.

We call the audio init routine from the ```demoInit``` function, like this:

```c
#ifdef __AMIGA__
  timeGet(&initBegin);
  timeGet(&initEffectBegin);
#endif

  demoAudioInit(tornadoOptions);

#ifdef __AMIGA__
  timeGet(&initEffectEnd);
  initTime = timeDiffSec(&initEffectBegin, &initEffectEnd);
#endif

  if (tornadoOptions & VERBOSE_DEBUGGING) {
    printf("DEBUG - demoAudioInit() completed in %u seconds\n", initTime);
  }
```

The last thing we need to do is tell the SDL_Mixer library to start playing the music on the sdl/POSIX target. This happens automagically on Amiga.

```c
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Main demo loop begins here...
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
void demoMain(unsigned int tornadoOptions, memoryLog *log) {

  int timings = 0;
  prof_enabled(timings);
  int loadEffect = 1;
  int mustExit = 0;
  int oldTime = 0;

  prof_reset();

#ifndef __AMIGA__
  if (tornadoOptions & USE_AUDIO) {
    double pos = (double)epoch / 50.0;
    Audio_ChannelSetPosition(pos);
    if (!rocket_control) {
      Audio_ChannelPlay();
    }
  }
#endif
```

Using modules and streaming music
------------------------------------------------

It is also possible to use both a module and streaming music in your demo. Capsule's demo [Brutalism](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=81062) has 2 modules and a compressed audio stream for the main part.

In order to switch between audio modes you have to call the ```setAudioMode``` function, declared in ```audio.h```. 

The two settings are:

* ```PCM_REPLAY_MODE``` : Switch to PCM replay and initialise the Paula output routines.
* ```P61_REPLAY_MODE``` : Shut down the Paula output routines and switch to P61 replay mode.

If you were playing an audio stream and want to play a module you switch modes before calling ```p61Init```. In Brutalism, the last effect of the demo loads a p61 module during initialisation and switches to the module when the effect starts, like this:

```c
t_canvas *renderEndscroll(int frame) 
{
    _frame = frame;

    int alpha = up_down_get_alpha (_fades, frame, 2);
    if (alpha >= 0)
        display_endscroll_fade_to (0, alpha);

    if (!music_started && (frame > TIME_MUSIC_START)) 
    {
#ifdef __AMIGA__
        setAudioMode(P61_REPLAY_MODE);
        p61Init(mod_data, 0, 0, 0);
        music_started = 1;
#endif
    }
```

Similarly, to switch from a module to streaming music we would call ```p61End``` and then switch to ```PCM_REPLAY_MODE```.
