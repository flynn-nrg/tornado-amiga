@{b}NAME@{ub}
@{fg shine}       @{b}AHI_AllocAudioA@{ub} -- allocates and initializes the audio hardware
       AHI_AllocAudio -- varargs stub for @{b}AHI_AllocAudioA@{ub}()

@{fg text}
@{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}
       audioctrl = @{b}AHI_AllocAudioA@{ub}( tags );
       D0                           A1

       struct AHIAudioCtrl *@{b}AHI_AllocAudioA@{ub}( struct TagItem * );

       audioctrl = AHI_AllocAudio( tag1, ... );

       struct AHIAudioCtrl *AHI_AllocAudio( Tag, ... );


@{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
       Allocates and initializes the audio hardware, selects the best
       mixing routine (if necessary) according to the supplied tags.
       To start playing you first need to call @{"AHI_ControlAudioA" Link "AHI_ControlAudioA"}().


@{b}INPUTS@{ub}
       tags - A pointer to a tag list.


@{b}TAGS@{ub}

       AHIA_AudioID (ULONG) - The audio mode to use. Default is
           AHI_DEFAULT_ID. (AHI_DEFAULT_ID is the ID the user has selected
           in the preferences program. It's a good value to use the first
           time she starts your application.)

       AHIA_MixFreq (ULONG) - Desired mixing frequency. The actual
           mixing rate may or may not be exactly what you asked for.
           Default is AHI_DEFAULT_FREQ. (AHI_DEFAULT_FREQ is the user's
           prefered frequency.)

       AHIA_Channels (UWORD) - Number of channel to use. The actual
           number of channels used will be equal or grater than the
           requested. If too many channels were requested, this function
           will fail. This tag must be supplied.

       AHIA_Sounds (UWORD) - Number of sounds to use. This tag must be
           supplied.

       AHIA_SoundFunc (struct Hook *) - A function to call each time
           when a sound has been started. The function receives the
           following parameters:
               A0 - (struct Hook *)
               A2 - (struct AHIAudioCtrl *)
               A1 - (struct AHISoundMessage *)
           The hook may be called from an interrupt, so normal interrupt
           restrictions apply.

           The called function should follow normal register conventions,
           which means that d2-d7 and a2-a6 must be preserved.

           Default is NULL.

       AHIA_PlayerFunc (struct Hook *) - A function to be called at regular
           intervals. By using this hook there is no need for music players
           to use other timing, such as VBLANK or CIA timers. But the real
           reason it's present is that it makes it possible to do non-
           realtime mixing to disk.

           Using this interrupt source is currently the only supported way
           to ensure that no mixing occurs between calls to AHI_SetVol(),
           AHI_SetFreq() or AHI_SetSound().

           If the sound playback is done without mixing, 'realtime.library'
           is used to provide timing. The function receives the following
           parameters:
               A0 - (struct Hook *)
               A2 - (struct AHIAudioCtrl *)
               A1 - Undefined.
           Do not assume A1 contains any particular value!
           The hook may be called from an interrupt, so normal interrupt
           restrictions apply.

           The called function should follow normal register conventions,
           which means that d2-d7 and a2-a6 must be preserved.

           Default is NULL.

       AHIA_PlayerFreq (Fixed) - If non-zero, enables timing and specifies
           how many times per second PlayerFunc will be called. This must
           be specified if AHIA_PlayerFunc is! Do not use any extreme
           frequencies. The result of MixFreq/PlayerFreq must fit an UWORD,
           ie it must be less or equal to 65535. It is also suggested that
           you keep the result over 80. For normal use this should not be a
           problem. Note that the data type is Fixed, not integer (see BUGS
           below). 50 Hz is 50<<16, which is a reasonable lower limit.

           Default is a reasonable value. Don't depend on it.

       AHIA_MinPlayerFreq (Fixed) - The minimum frequency (AHIA_PlayerFreq)
           you will use. You MUST supply this if you are using the device's
           interrupt feature!

       AHIA_MaxPlayerFreq (Fixed) - The maximum frequency (AHIA_PlayerFreq)
           you will use. You MUST supply this if you are using the device's
           interrupt feature!

       AHIA_RecordFunc (struct Hook *) - This function will be called
           regularly when sampling is turned on (see @{"AHI_ControlAudioA" Link "AHI_ControlAudioA"}())
           with the following parameters:
               A0 - (struct Hook *)
               A2 - (struct AHIAudioCtrl *)
               A1 - (struct AHIRecordMessage *)
           The message (AHIRecordMessage) is filled as follows:
               ahirm_Buffer - Pointer to the samples. The buffer is valid
                   until next time the Hook is called.
               ahirm_Length - Number of sample FRAMES in buffer.
                   To get the size in bytes, multiply by 4 if ahiim_Type is
                   AHIST_S16S.
               ahirm_Type - Always AHIST_S16S at the moment, but you *must*
                   check this, since it may change in the future!
           The hook may be called from an interrupt, so normal interrupt
           restrictions apply. Signal a process if you wish to save the
           buffer to disk. The called function should follow normal register
           conventions, which means that d2-d7 and a2-a6 must be preserved.

           NOTE: The function MUST return NULL (in d0). This was previously
           not documented. Now you know.

           Default is NULL.

       AHIA_UserData (APTR) - Can be used to initialize the ahiac_UserData
           field. Default is 0.


@{b}RESULT@{ub}
       A pointer to an AHIAudioCtrl structure or NULL if an error occured.


@{b}EXAMPLE@{ub}


@{b}NOTES@{ub}
@{fg shine}       SoundFunc will be called in the same manner as Paula interrupts
       occur; when the device has updated its internal variables and can
       accept new commands.

@{fg text}
@{b}BUGS@{ub}
@{fg shine}       For compability reasons with some really old applications,
       AHIA_PlayerFreq, AHIA_MinPlayerFreq and AHIA_MaxPlayerFreq 
       interpret values lower than 0x10000 as integers, not Fixed.
       This means that the lowest frequency possible is 1 Hz. However,
       you should *never* use a value than say 10-20 Hz anyway, because
       of the high latency and the impact on multitasking. 

       This kludge will be removed some day. Always use Fixed!

       BOOL AHI_AudioRequest( struct AHIAudioModeRequester *, Tag, ... );


@{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
       Prompts the user for an audio mode, based on the modifying tags.
       If the user cancels or the system aborts the request, FALSE is
       returned, otherwise the requester's data structure reflects the
       user input.

       Note that tag values stay in effect for each use of the requester
       until they are cleared or modified by passing the same tag with a
       new value.


@{b}INPUTS@{ub}
       requester - Requester structure allocated with
           @{"AHI_AllocAudioRequestA" Link "AHI_AllocAudioRequestA"}(). If this parameter is NULL, this
           function will always return FALSE with a dos.library/IoErr()
           result of ERROR_NO_FREE_STORE.
       tags - Pointer to an optional tag list which may be used to control
           features of the requester.


@{b}TAGS@{ub}
       Tags used for the requester (they look remarkable similar to the
       screen mode requester in ASL, don't they? ;-) )

       AHIR_Window (struct Window *) - Parent window of requester. If no
           AHIR_Screen tag is specified, the window structure is used to
           determine on which screen to open the requesting window.

       AHIR_PubScreenName (STRPTR) - Name of a public screen to open on.
           This overrides the screen used by AHIR_Window.

       AHIR_Screen (struct Screen *) - Screen on which to open the
           requester. This overrides the screen used by AHIR_Window or by
           AHIR_PubScreenName.

       AHIR_PrivateIDCMP (BOOL) - When set to TRUE, this tells AHI to
           allocate a new IDCMP port for the requesting window. If not
           specified or set to FALSE, and if AHIR_Window is provided, the
           requesting window will share AHIR_Window's IDCMP port.

       AHIR_IntuiMsgFunc (struct Hook *) - A function to call whenever an
           unknown Intuition message arrives at the message port being used
           by the requesting window. The function receives the following
           parameters:
               A0 - (struct Hook *)
               A1 - (struct IntuiMessage *)
               A2 - (struct AHIAudioModeRequester *)

       AHIR_SleepWindow (BOOL) - When set to TRUE, this tag will cause the
           window specified by AHIR_Window to be "put to sleep". That is, a
           busy pointer will be displayed in the parent window, and no
           gadget or menu activity will be allowed. This is done by opening
           an invisible Intuition Requester in the parent window.

       AHIR_UserData (APTR) - A 32-bit value that is simply copied in the
           ahiam_UserData field of the requester structure.

       AHIR_TextAttr (struct TextAttr *) - Font to be used for the
           requesting window's gadgets and menus. If this tag is not
           provided or its value is NULL, the default font of the screen
           on which the requesting window opens will be used. This font
           must already be in memory as AHI calls OpenFont() and not
           OpenDiskFont().

       AHIR_Locale (struct Locale *) - Locale to use for the requesting
           window. This determines the language used for the requester's
           gadgets and menus. If this tag is not provided or its value is
           NULL, the system's current default locale will be used.

       AHIR_TitleText (STRPTR) - Title to use for the requesting window.
           Default is no title.

       AHIR_PositiveText (STRPTR) - Label of the positive gadget in the
           requester. English default is "OK".

       AHIR_NegativeText (STRPTR) - Label of the negative gadget in the
           requester. English default is "Cancel".

       AHIR_InitialLeftEdge (WORD) - Suggested left edge of requesting
           window.

       AHIR_InitialTopEdge (WORD) - Suggested top edge of requesting
           window.

       AHIR_InitialWidth (WORD) - Suggested width of requesting window.

       AHIR_InitialHeight (WORD) - Suggested height of requesting window.

       AHIR_InitialAudioID (ULONG) - Initial setting of the Mode list view
           gadget (ahiam_AudioID). Default is ~0 (AHI_INVALID_ID), which
           means that no mode will be selected.

       AHIR_InitialMixFreq (ULONG) - Initial setting of the frequency
           slider. Default is the lowest frequency supported.

       AHIR_InitialInfoOpened (BOOL) - Whether to open the property
           information window automatically. Default is FALSE.

       AHIR_InitialInfoLeftEdge (WORD) - Initial left edge of information
           window.

       AHIR_InitialInfoTopEdge (WORD) - Initial top edge of information
           window.

       AHIR_DoMixFreq (BOOL) - Set this tag to TRUE to cause the requester
           to display the frequency slider gadget. Default is FALSE.

       AHIR_DoDefaultMode (BOOL) - Set this tag to TRUE to let the user
           select the mode she has set in the preferences program. If she
           selects this mode,  ahiam_AudioID will be AHI_DEFAULT_ID and
           ahiam_MixFreq will be AHI_DEFAULT_FREQ. Note that if you filter
           the mode list (see below), you must also check the mode (with
           @{"AHI_BestAudioIDA" Link "AHI_BestAudioIDA"}()) before you use it since the user may change 
           the meaning of AHI_DEFAULT_MODE anytime, without your knowledge.
           Default is FALSE. (V4)

       AHIR_FilterFunc (struct Hook *) - A function to call for each mode
           encountered. If the function returns TRUE, the mode is included
           in the file list, otherwise it is rejected and not displayed. The
           function receives the following parameters:
               A0 - (struct Hook *)
               A1 - (ULONG) mode id
               A2 - (struct AHIAudioModeRequester *)

       AHIR_FilterTags (struct TagItem *) - A pointer to a tag list used to
           filter modes away, like AHIR_FilterFunc does. The tags are the
           same as @{"AHI_BestAudioIDA" Link "AHI_BestAudioIDA"}() takes as arguments. See that function
           for an explanation of each tag.


@{b}RESULT@{ub}
       result - FALSE if the user cancelled the requester or if something
           prevented the requester from opening. If TRUE, values in the
           requester structure will be set.

           If the return value is FALSE, you can look at the result from the
           dos.library/IoErr() function to determine whether the requester
           was cancelled or simply failed to open. If dos.library/IoErr()
           returns 0, then the requester was cancelled, any other value
           indicates a failure to open. Current possible failure codes are
           ERROR_NO_FREE_STORE which indicates there was not enough memory,
           and ERROR_NO_MORE_ENTRIES which indicates no modes were available
           (usually because the application filter hook filtered them all
           away).


@{b}EXAMPLE@{ub}


@{b}NOTES@{ub}
@{fg shine}       The requester data structure is READ-ONLY and can only be modified
       by using tags!

       The mixing/recording frequencies that are presented to the user
       may not be the only ones a driver supports, but just a selection.

@{b}TAGS@{ub}
       Many combinations are probably stupid to ask for, like not supporting
       panning or recording.

       AHIDB_AudioID (ULONG) - The mode must use the same audio hardware
           as this mode does.

       AHIDB_Volume (BOOL) - If TRUE: mode must support volume changes.
           If FALSE: mode must not support volume changes.

           play at the same time.

       AHIDB_Bits (UBYTE) - Mode must have greater or equal number of bits.

       AHIDB_MaxChannels (UWORD) - Mode must have greater or equal number

       AHIDB_MaxMixFreq (ULONG) - Highest mixing frequency must be greater
           or equal.

       AHIB_Dizzy (struct TagItem *) - This tag points to a second tag list.
           After all other tags has been tested, the mode that matches these
           tags best is returned, i.e. the one that has most of the features
           you ask for, and least of the ones you don't want. Without this
           second tag list, this function hardly does what its name
           suggests. (V4)

@{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
       This function should be used to change attributes for a given
       AHIAudioCtrl structure. It is also used to start and stop playback,
       and to control special hardware found on some sound cards.


@{b}INPUTS@{ub}
       audioctrl - A pointer to an AHIAudioCtrl structure.
       tags - A pointer to a tag list.


@{b}TAGS@{ub}
       AHIC_Play (BOOL) - Starts (TRUE) and stops (FALSE) playback and
           PlayerFunc. NOTE: If the audio hardware cannot play at the same
           time as recording samples, the recording will be stopped.

       AHIC_Record (BOOL) - Starts (TRUE) and stops (FALSE) sampling and
           RecordFunc. NOTE: If the audio hardware cannot record at the same
           time as playing samples, the playback will be stopped.

       AHIC_MonitorVolume (Fixed) - Sets the input monitor volume, i.e. how
           much of the input signal is mixed with the output signal while
           recording. Use @{"AHI_GetAudioAttrsA" Link "AHI_GetAudioAttrsA"}() to find the available range.

       AHIC_MonitorVolume_Query (Fixed *) - Get the current input monitor
           volume. ti_Data is a pointer to a Fixed variable, where the result
           will be stored.

       AHIC_MixFreq_Query (ULONG *) - Get the current mixing frequency.
           ti_Data is a pointer to an ULONG variable, where the result will
           be stored.

       AHIC_InputGain (Fixed) - Set the input gain. Use @{"AHI_GetAudioAttrsA" Link "AHI_GetAudioAttrsA"}()
           to find the available range. (V2)

       AHIC_InputGain_Query (Fixed *) - Get current input gain. (V2)

           @{"AHI_GetAudioAttrsA" Link "AHI_GetAudioAttrsA"}() to find the available range. (V2)

       AHIC_OutputVolume_Query (Fixed *) - Get current output volume. (V2)

       AHIC_Input (ULONG) - Select input source. See @{"AHI_GetAudioAttrsA" Link "AHI_GetAudioAttrsA"}().
           (V2)

       AHIC_Input_Query (ULONG *) - Get current input source. (V2)

       AHIC_Output (ULONG) - Select destination for output. See

       AHIC_Output_Query (ULONG *) - Get destination for output. (V2)

       The following tags are also recognized by @{b}AHI_ControlAudioA@{ub}(). See

       AHIA_PlayerFreq (Fixed)
       AHIA_RecordFunc (struct Hook *)
       AHIA_UserData (APTR)

       Note that AHIA_PlayerFreq must never be outside the limits specified
       with AHIA_MinPlayerFreq and AHIA_MaxPlayerFreq! Also note that the
       timing feature is designed to be used for music. When you change the
       frequency, be reasonable. Using 50 Hz one moment and 5 the other is
       to ask for trouble.

@{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
       Retrieve information about an audio mode specified by ID or audioctrl
       according to the tags in the tag list. For each entry in the tag
       list, ti_Tag identifies the attribute, and ti_Data is mostly a
       pointer to a LONG (4 bytes) variable where you wish the result to be
       stored.


@{b}INPUTS@{ub}
       ID - An audio mode identifier, AHI_DEFAULT_ID (V4) or AHI_INVALID_ID.
       audioctrl - A pointer to an AHIAudioCtrl structure, only used if
           ID equals AHI_INVALID_ID. Set to NULL if not used. If set to
           NULL when used, this function returns immediately. Always set
           ID to AHI_INVALID_ID and use audioctrl if you have allocated
           a valid AHIAudioCtrl structure. Some of the tags return incorrect
           values otherwise.
       tags - A pointer to a tag list.


@{b}TAGS@{ub}
       AHIDB_Volume (ULONG *) - TRUE if this mode supports volume changes.

       AHIDB_Stereo (ULONG *) - TRUE if output is in stereo. Unless
           AHIDB_Panning (see below) is TRUE, all even channels are played
           to the left and all odd to the right.

       AHIDB_MultiChannel (ULONG *) - TRUE if output is in 7.1 channels.

       AHIDB_Panning (ULONG *) - TRUE if this mode supports stereo panning.

       AHIDB_HiFi (ULONG *) - TRUE if no shortcuts, like pre-division, is
           used by the mixing routines.

       AHIDB_PingPong (ULONG *) - TRUE if this mode can play samples backwards.

       AHIDB_Record (ULONG *) - TRUE if this mode can record samples.

       AHIDB_FullDuplex (ULONG *) - TRUE if this mode can record and play at
           the same time.

       AHIDB_Realtime (ULONG *) - Modes which return TRUE for this fulfills
           two criteria:
           1) Calls to AHI_SetVol(), AHI_SetFreq() or AHI_SetSound() will be
              performed within (about) 10 ms if called from a PlayFunc Hook.
           2) The PlayFunc Hook will be called at the specified frequency.
           If you don't use AHI's PlayFunc Hook, you must not use modes that
           are not realtime. (Criterium 2 is not that obvious if you consider
           a mode that renders the output to disk as a sample.)

       AHIDB_Bits (ULONG *) - The number of output bits (8, 12, 14, 16 etc).

       AHIDB_MaxChannels (ULONG *) - The maximum number of channels this mode
           can handle.

       AHIDB_MinMixFreq (ULONG *) - The minimum mixing frequency supported.

           NOTE: ti_Data is NOT a pointer, but an ULONG.

       AHIDB_Frequency (ULONG *) - Return the frequency associated with the
           index number specified with AHIDB_FrequencyArg (see above).

       AHIDB_IndexArg (ULONG) - AHIDB_Index will return the index which
           gives the closest frequency to AHIDB_IndexArg
           NOTE: ti_Data is NOT a pointer, but an ULONG.

       AHIDB_Index (ULONG *) - Return the index associated with the frequency
           specified with AHIDB_IndexArg (see above).

       AHIDB_MaxPlaySamples (ULONG *) - Return the lowest number of sample
           frames that must be present in memory when AHIST_DYNAMICSAMPLE
           sounds are used. This number must then be scaled by Fs/Fm, where
           Fs is the frequency of the sound and Fm is the mixing frequency.

       AHIDB_MaxRecordSamples (ULONG *) - Return the number of sample frames
           you will receive each time the RecordFunc is called.

       AHIDB_BufferLen (ULONG) - Specifies how many characters will be
           copied when requesting text attributes. Default is 0, which
           means that AHIDB_Driver, AHIDB_Name, AHIDB_Author,
           AHIDB_Copyright, AHIDB_Version and AHIDB_Annotation,
           AHIDB_Input and AHIDB_Output will do nothing.

           extension). 
           NOTE: ti_Data is a pointer to an UBYTE array where the name
           will be stored. See AHIDB_BufferLen.

       AHIDB_Name (STRPTR) - Human readable name of this mode.

           will be stored. See AHIDB_BufferLen.

       AHIDB_MinMonitorVolume (Fixed *)
       AHIDB_MaxMonitorVolume (Fixed *) - Lower/upper limit for input
           monitor volume, see @{"AHI_ControlAudioA" Link "AHI_ControlAudioA"}(). If both are 0.0,
           the sound hardware does not have an input monitor feature.
           If both are same, but not 0.0, the hardware always sends the

@{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
       Defines an ID number for the sound and prepares it for playback.


@{b}INPUTS@{ub}
       sound - The numeric ID to be used as a reference to this sound.
           The ID is a number greater or equal to 0 and less than what you
           specified with AHIA_Sounds when you called @{"AHI_AllocAudioA" Link "AHI_AllocAudioA"}().
       type - The type of the sound. Currently four types are supported:
           AHIST_SAMPLE - array of 8 or 16 bit samples. Note that the
               portion of memory where the sample is stored must NOT be
               altered until @{"AHI_UnloadSound" Link "AHI_UnloadSound"}() has been called! This is
               because some audio drivers may wish to upload the samples
               to local RAM. It is OK to read, though.

           AHIST_DYNAMICSAMPLE - array of 8 or 16 bit samples, which can be
               updated dynamically. Typically used to play data that is
               loaded from disk or calculated realtime.
               Avoid using this sound type as much as possible; it will
               use much more CPU power than AHIST_SAMPLE on a DMA/DSP
               sound card.

       info - Depends on type:
           AHIST_SAMPLE - A pointer to a struct AHISampleInfo, filled with:
               ahisi_Type - Format of samples (four formats are supported).
                   AHIST_M8S: Mono, 8 bit signed (BYTEs).
                   AHIST_S8S: Stereo, 8 bit signed (2×BYTEs) (V4). 
                   AHIST_M16S: Mono, 16 bit signed (WORDs).
                   AHIST_S16S: Stereo, 16 bit signed (2×WORDs) (V4).
                   AHIST_M32S: Mono, 32 bit signed (LONGs). (V6)
                   AHIST_S32S: Stereo, 32 bit signed (2×LONGs) (V6).
                   AHIST_L7_1: 7.1, 32 bit signed (8×LONGs) (V6).
               ahisi_Address - Address to the sample array.
               ahisi_Length - The size of the array, in samples.
               Don't even think of setting ahisi_Address to 0 and
               ahisi_Length to 0xffffffff as you can do with
               AHIST_DYNAMICSAMPLE! Very few DMA/DSP cards have 4 GB onboard
               RAM...

           AHIST_DYNAMICSAMPLE A pointer to a struct AHISampleInfo, filled
               as described above (AHIST_SAMPLE).
               If ahisi_Address is 0 and ahisi_Length is 0xffffffff
               AHI_SetSound() can take the real address of an 8 bit sample
               to be played as offset argument. Unfortunately, this does not
               work for 16 bit samples.

       void AHI_Play( struct AHIAudioCtrl *, Tag, ... );


@{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
       This function performs the same actions as multiple calls to
       AHI_SetFreq(), AHI_SetSound() and AHI_SetVol(). The advantages
       of using only one call is that simple loops can be set without
       using a SoundFunc (see @{"AHI_AllocAudioA" Link "AHI_AllocAudioA"}(), tag AHIA_SoundFunc) and
       that sounds on different channels can be synchronized even when the
       sounds are not started from a PlayerFunc (see @{"AHI_AllocAudioA" Link "AHI_AllocAudioA"}(), tag
       AHIA_PlayerFunc). The disadvantage is that this call has more
       overhead than AHI_SetFreq(), AHI_SetSound() and AHI_SetVol(). It is
       therefore recommended that you only use this call if you are not
       calling from a SoundFunc or PlayerFunc.

       The supplied tag list works like a 'program'. This means that
       the order of tags matter.


@{b}INPUTS@{ub}
       audioctrl - A pointer to an AHIAudioCtrl structure.
       tags - A pointer to a tag list.


@{b}TAGS@{ub}
       AHIP_BeginChannel (UWORD) - Before you start setting attributes
           for a sound to play, you have to use this tag to chose a
           channel to operate on. If AHIP_BeginChannel is omitted, the
           result is undefined.

       AHIP_EndChannel (ULONG) - Signals the end of attributes for
           the current channel. If AHIP_EndChannel is omitted, the result
           is undefined. ti_Data MUST BE NULL!

       AHIP_Freq (ULONG) - The playback frequency in Hertz or AHI_MIXFREQ.

       AHIP_Vol (Fixed) - The desired volume. If omitted, but AHIP_Pan is
           present, AHIP_Vol defaults to 0.

       AHIP_Pan (sposition) - The desired panning. If omitted, but AHIP_Vol
           is present, AHIP_Pan defaults to 0 (extreme left).

       AHIP_Sound (UWORD) - Sound to be played, or AHI_NOSOUND.

       AHIP_Offset (ULONG) - Specifies an offset (in samples) into the
           sound. If this tag is present, AHIP_Length MUST be present too!

       AHIP_Length (LONG) - Specifies how many samples that should be
           played.

       AHIP_LoopFreq (ULONG)
       AHIP_LoopVol (Fixed)
       AHIP_LoopPan (sposition)
       AHIP_LoopSound (UWORD)
       AHIP_LoopOffset (ULONG)
       AHIP_LoopLength (LONG) - These tags can be used to set simple loop
          attributes. They default to their sisters. These tags must be
          after the other tags.

       ioRequest - a pointer to a struct AHIRequest, initialized by
           exec.library/CreateIORequest(). ahir_Version *must* be preset
           to the version you need!
       flags - There is only one flag defined, AHIDF_NOMODESCAN, which
           asks ahi.device not to build the audio mode database if not
           already initialized. It should not be used by applications
           without good reasons (AddAudioModes uses this flag).


@{b}RESULT@{ub}
       error - Same as io_Error.
       io_Error - If the call succeeded, io_Error will be 0, else
           an error code as defined in <exec/errors.h> and
           <devices/ahi.h>.
       io_Device - A pointer to the device base, which can be used
           to call the functions the device provides.
