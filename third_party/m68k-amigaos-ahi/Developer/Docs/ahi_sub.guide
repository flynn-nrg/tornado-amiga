@{b}OVERVIEW@{ub}

       GENERAL PROGRAMMING GUIDLINES

       The driver must be able to be OpenLibrary()'ed even if the
       hardware is not present. If a library the driver uses fails
       to open, it is ok to fail at the library init routine, but please
       avoid it if possible.

       Please note that this document could be much better, but since not
       many will ever need to read it, it will probably stay this way.
       Don't hesitate to contact Martin Blom when you're writing a driver!

       DRIVER VERSIONS

       The lowest supported driver version is 2. If you use any feature
       introduced in later versions of AHI, you should set the driver
       version to the same version as the features were introduced with.
       Example: You use PreTimer() and PostTimer(), and since these
       calls were added in V4 of ahi.device, your driver's version should
       be 4, too.

       Note that AHI version 4 will not open V6 drivers, for obvious
       reasons.

       AUDIO ID NUMBERS

       Just some notes about selecting ID numbers for different modes:
       It is up to the driver programmer to chose which modes should be
       available to the user. Take care when selecting.

       The upper word is the hardware ID, and can only be allocated by
       Martin Blom <lcs\@lysator.liu.se>. The lower word is free, but in
       order to allow enhancements, please only use bit 0 to 4 for modes!
       If your driver supports multiple sound cards, use bit 12-15 to
       select card (first one is 0). If your sound card has multiple
       AD/DA converters, you can use bit 8-11 to select them (the first
       should be 0).

       Set the remaining bits to zero.

       Use AHI:Developer/Support/ScanAudioModes to have a look at the modes
       currently available. Use AHI:Developer/Support/sift to make sure your
       mode descriptor file is a legal IFF file.

       I do reserve the right to change the rules if I find them incorrect!

       If @{"AHIsub_AllocAudio" Link "AHIsub_AllocAudio"}() did not return with bit AHISB_MIXING set,
       all user calls to these function will be routed to the driver.

       If @{"AHIsub_AllocAudio" Link "AHIsub_AllocAudio"}() did return with bit AHISB_MIXING set, the
       calls will first be routed to the driver, and only handled by
       'ahi.device' if the driver returned AHIS_UNKNOWN. This way it is
       possible to add effects that the sound card handles on its own, like
       filter and echo effects.

@{b}IMPLEMENTATION@{ub}
       Allocate and initialize the audio hardware. Decide if and how you
       wish to use the mixing routines provided by 'ahi.device', by looking
       in the AHIAudioCtrlDrv structure and parsing the tag list for tags
       you support.

       1) Use mixing routines with timing:
           You will need to be able to play any number of samples from
           about 80 up to 65535 with low overhead.
            Update AudioCtrl->ahiac_MixFreq to nearest value that your
             hardware supports.
            Return AHISF_MIXING|AHISF_TIMING.

       2) Use mixing routines without timing:
           If the hardware can't play samples with any length, use this
           alternative and provide timing yourself. The buffer must
           take less than about 20 ms to play, preferable less than 10!
            Update AudioCtrl->ahiac_MixFreq to nearest value that your
             hardware supports.
            Store the number of samples to mix each pass in
             AudioCtrl->ahiac_BuffSamples.
            Return AHISF_MIXING
           Alternatively, you can use the first method and call the
           mixing hook several times in a row to fill up a buffer.
           In that case, @{"AHIsub_GetAttr" Link "AHIsub_GetAttr"}(AHIDB_MaxPlaySamples) should
           return the size of the buffer plus AudioCtrl->ahiac_MaxBuffSamples.
           If the buffer is so large that it takes more than (approx.) 10 ms to
           play it for high sample frequencies, @{"AHIsub_GetAttr" Link "AHIsub_GetAttr"}(AHIDB_Realtime)
           should return FALSE.

       3) Don't use mixing routines:
           If your hardware can handle everything without using the CPU to
           mix the channels, you tell 'ahi.device' this by not setting
           either the AHISB_MIXING or the AHISB_TIMING bit.

       If you can handle stereo output from the mixing routines, also set
       bit AHISB_KNOWSTEREO.

       If you can handle hifi (32 bit) output from the mixing routines,
       set bit AHISB_KNOWHIFI.

       If this driver can be used to record samples, set bit AHISB_CANRECORD,
       too (regardless if you use the mixing routines in AHI or not).

       If the sound card has hardware to do DSP effects, you can set the
       AHISB_CANPOSTPROCESS bit. The output from the mixing routines will 
       then be two separate buffers, one wet and one dry. You should then
       apply the Fx on the wet buffer, and post-mix the two buffers before
       you send the samples to the DAC. (V4)

@{b}IMPLEMENTATION@{ub}
       What to do depends what you returned in @{"AHIsub_AllocAudio" Link "AHIsub_AllocAudio"}().

     * First, assume bit AHISB_PLAY in flags is set. This means that you
       should begin playback.

     - @{"AHIsub_AllocAudio" Link "AHIsub_AllocAudio"}() returned AHISF_MIXING|AHISF_TIMING:

       A) Allocate a mixing buffer of ahiac_BuffSize bytes. The buffer must
          be long aligned!
       B) Create/start an interrupt or task that will do 1-6 over and over
          again until @{"AHIsub_Stop" Link "AHIsub_Stop"}() is called. Note that it is not a good
          idea to do the actual mixing and conversion in a real hardware
          interrupt. Signal a task or create a Software Interrupt to do
          the number crunching.

       1) Call the user Hook ahiac_PlayerFunc with the following parameters:
                  A0 - (struct Hook *)
                  A2 - (struct AHIAudioCtrlDrv *)
                  A1 - Set to NULL.

       2) [Call the ahiac_PreTimer function. If it returns TRUE (Z will be
          cleared so you don't have to test d0), skip step 3 and 4. This
          is used to avoid overloading the CPU. This step is optional.
          A2 is assumed to point to struct AHIAudioCtrlDrv. All registers
          except d0 are preserved. (V4)

          Starting with V6, you can also call the pre-timer Hook
          (ahiac_PreTimerFunc) with the following parameters:
                  A0 - (struct Hook *)           - The Hook itself
                  A2 - (struct AHIAudioCtrlDrv *)
                  A1 - Set to NULL.
          The Hook is not guaranteed to preserve all registers and
          you must check the return value and not rely on the Z flag. (V6)

          This step, 2, is optional.]

       3) Call the mixing Hook (ahiac_MixerFunc) with the following
          parameters:
                  A0 - (struct Hook *)           - The Hook itself
                  A2 - (struct AHIAudioCtrlDrv *)
                  A1 - (WORD *[])                - The mixing buffer.
          Note that ahiac_MixerFunc preserves ALL registers.
          The user Hook ahiac_SoundFunc will be called by the mixing
          routine when a sample have been processed, so you don't have to
          worry about that.
          How the buffer will be filled is indicated by ahiac_Flags.
          It is always filled with signed 16-bit (32 bit if AHIACB_HIFI in
          in ahiac_Flags is set) words, even if playback is 8 bit. If
          AHIDBB_STEREO is set (in ahiac_Flags), data for left and right
          channel are interleaved:
           1st sample left channel,
           1st sample right channel,
           2nd sample left channel,
           ...,
           ahiac_BuffSamples:th sample left channel,
           ahiac_BuffSamples:th sample right channel.
          If AHIDBB_STEREO is cleared, the mono data is stored:
           1st sample,
           2nd sample,
           ...,
           ahiac_BuffSamples:th sample.
          Note that neither AHIACB_STEREO nor AHIACB_HIFI will be set if
          you didn't report that you understand these flags when
          AHI_AllocAudio() was called.

          For AHI V2, the type of buffer is also available in ahiac_BuffType.
          It is suggested that you use this value instead. ahiac_BuffType
          can be one of AHIST_M16S, AHIST_S16S, AHIST_M32S and AHIST_S32S.

       4) Convert the buffer if needed and feed it to the audio hardware.
          Note that you may have to clear CPU caches if you are using DMA
          to play the buffer, and the buffer is not allocated in non-
          cachable RAM (which is not a good idea anyway, for performace
          reasons).

       5) [Call the ahiac_PostTimer function. A2 is assumed to point to
          struct AHIAudioCtrlDrv. All registers are preserved. (V4)

          Starting with V6, you can also call the post-timer Hook
          (ahiac_PostTimerFunc) with the following parameters:
                  A0 - (struct Hook *)           - The Hook itself
                  A2 - (struct AHIAudioCtrlDrv *)
                  A1 - Set to NULL.
          The Hook is not guaranteed to preserve all registers. (V6)

          This step, 5, is optional.]

       6) Wait until the whole buffer has been played, then repeat.

       Use double buffering if possible!

       You may DECREASE ahiac_BuffSamples slightly, for example to force an
       even number of samples to be mixed. By doing this you will make
       ahiac_PlayerFunc to be called at wrong frequency so be careful!
       Even if ahiac_BuffSamples is defined ULONG, it will never be greater
       than 65535.

       ahiac_BuffSize is the largest size of the mixing buffer that will be
       needed until @{"AHIsub_Stop" Link "AHIsub_Stop"}() is called.

       ahiac_MaxBuffSamples is the maximum number of samples that will be
       mixed (until @{"AHIsub_Stop" Link "AHIsub_Stop"}() is called). You can use this value if you
       need to allocate DMA buffers.

       ahiac_MinBuffSamples is the minimum number of samples that will be
       mixed. Most drivers will ignore it.

       If @{"AHIsub_AllocAudio" Link "AHIsub_AllocAudio"}() returned with the AHISB_CANPOSTPROCESS bit set,
       ahiac_BuffSize is large enough to hold two buffers. The mixing buffer
       will be filled with the wet buffer first, immediately followed by the
       dry buffer. I.e., ahiac_BuffSamples sample frames wet data, then
       ahiac_BuffSamples sample frames dry data. The DSP fx should only be
       applied to the wet buffer, and the two buffers should then be added
       together. (V4)

     - If @{"AHIsub_AllocAudio" Link "AHIsub_AllocAudio"}() returned AHISF_MIXING, do as described above,
       except calling ahiac_PlayerFunc. ahiac_PlayerFunc should be called
       ahiac_PlayerFreq times per second, clocked by timers on your sound
       card or by using 'timer.device' or 'realtime.library'. No other Amiga
       resources may be used for timing (like direct CIA timers).
       ahiac_MinBuffSamples and ahiac_MaxBuffSamples are undefined if
       @{"AHIsub_AllocAudio" Link "AHIsub_AllocAudio"}() returned AHISF_MIXING (AHISB_TIMING bit not set).

     - If @{"AHIsub_AllocAudio" Link "AHIsub_AllocAudio"}() returned with neither the AHISB_MIXING nor
       the AHISB_TIMING bit set, then just start playback. Don't forget to
       call ahiac_PlayerFunc ahiac_PlayerFreq times per second. Only your
       own timing hardware, 'timer.device'  or 'realtime.library' may be
       used. Note that ahiac_MixerFunc, ahiac_BuffSamples,
       ahiac_MinBuffSamples, ahiac_MaxBuffSamples and ahiac_BuffSize are
       undefined. ahiac_MixFreq is the frequency the user wants to use for
       recording, if you support that.

     * Second, assume bit AHISB_RECORD in flags is set. This means that you
       should start to sample. Create a interrupt or task that does the
       following:

       Allocate a buffer (you chose size, but try to keep it reasonable
       small to avoid delays - it is suggested that RecordFunc is called
       at least 4 times/second for the lowers sampling rate, and more often
       for higher rates), and fill it with the sampled data. The buffer must
       be long aligned, and it's size must be evenly divisible by four.
       The format should always be AHIST_S16S (even with 8 bit mono samplers),
       which means:
           1st sample left channel,
           1st sample right channel (same as prev. if mono),
           2nd sample left channel,
           ... etc.
       Each sample is a signed word (WORD). The sample rate should be equal
       to the mixing rate.

       Call the ahiac_SamplerFunc Hook with the following parameters:
           A0 - (struct Hook *)           - The Hook itself
           A2 - (struct AHIAudioCtrlDrv *)
           A1 - (struct AHIRecordMessage *)
       The message should be filled as follows:
           ahirm_Type - Set to AHIST_S16S.
           ahirm_Buffer - A pointer to the filled buffer.
           ahirm_Samples - How many sample frames stored.
       You must not destroy the buffer until next time the Hook is called.

       Repeat until @{"AHIsub_Stop" Link "AHIsub_Stop"}() is called.

     * Note that both bits may be set when this function is called.
